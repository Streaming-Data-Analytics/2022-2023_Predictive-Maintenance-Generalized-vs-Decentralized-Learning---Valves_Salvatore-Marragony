# 2022-2023 Predictive Maintenance â€“ Generalized vs Decentralized Learning - Valves
### Salvatore Marragony - 10617299

This is the repo for the project of the Streaming Data Analystics course. The aim was to compare Neural Network techniques with streaming techniques in the context of anomaly detection.

The data are samples of noises preprocessed from valves and the aim is to tell whether the noise corresponds to a normal functioning valve or to a valve with anomaly. It was interesting to show the comparison between the two approaches and between working with the different valves separately or putting them all together.

To reproduce the results it is sufficient to download the jupyter notebook making sure that the paths to the data are correct. In order to perform the transfer learning in the SML part it is possible to use the models in this repository or to recreate them from scratch by running the code of the first part.
